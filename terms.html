        <h1>Disclosures, Terms, Conditions, And Privacy Policy</h1>
        <hr>
    		<p>Dear reader,</p>
        <p>Basic Gym Tips is my business. I actually earn pretty much all of my money through the work I do on this site.</p>
        <p>As my business is based around&nbsp;<strong>trust&nbsp;</strong>that my readers have in me, I want to be as clear as possible as to what I do and how I earn my dolla bills.</p>
        <p>I earn money on this site in several ways, including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Sales of my own products</li>
        <li>Affiliate commissions</li>
        <li>YouTube advertisements</li>
        <li>Partnerships</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I participate in a few affiliate programs, including (but not limited to) Amazon, HostGator, NameCheap, and Lynda.</p>
        <p>All of the products I receive affiliate commissions for are ones that I believe in whole-heartedly and in most cases use myself.</p>
        <p>In the case of partnerships with companies, I only agree to a partnership if I believe in the product and the company itself. Past partnerships have included Adobe, Sony, and Vonage.</p>
